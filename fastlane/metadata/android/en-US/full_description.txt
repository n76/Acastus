This app was born out of the demise of AddressToGPS and a desire to have a way
to inject test addresses into a microG geocoder backend.
- It uses the Google API for address to lat/lon lookup
- It uses the Google Maps API v2 for display of addresses found by the lookup
- Use of Google APIs can correctly be considered "anti-features" but is needed to work with microG.
- But it does not have a valid Maps API key so the map functionality does not work on most Android phones.
- It is intended to be run on a phone that has microG installed along with at least one microG address provider plug-ins.
