Release 1.0.0 based on Acastus v1.13
- Use Google address API to access microG geocoder. Will probably also work on phone using gapps.
- Use Google Maps API v2 to display map. Intended for use with microG and will not work on gapps as there is no valid API key.
- Changed metadata, project name, etc. to show this is a new project but keeping git history to show where it came from.
